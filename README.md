**Project Overview**:
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical data. By using machine learning algorithms, we provide a predictive model that helps healthcare professionals identify high-risk diabetic patients. The goal is to help in early diagnosis and intervention, improving patient care and outcomes.

**Technologies Used**:
Python (Programming Language) 
Pandas (Data manipulation) 
NumPy (Numerical computations) 
Scikit-Learn (Machine learning models) 
Matplotlib / Seaborn (Data visualization) 
Jupyter Notebook (Interactive environment for development) 
Flask (For building web application, if applicable) 
**Dataset:**
-->The dataset used in this project is from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, available publicly. It contains information on patients' medical history such as:

Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies 
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test 
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm) 
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) 
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2) 
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that represents the likelihood of diabetes based on family history 
Age: Age of the patient 
Outcome: Whether the patient is diabetic (1) or not (0)

**How It Works** 
**Data Preprocessing:**
-->Handle missing values. 
-->Normalize the data. 
-->Split the data into training and testing sets. 
**Model Building:**
-->Multiple machine learning algorithms are tested, including:
-->Logistic Regression 
-->Random Forest 
-->Support Vector Machines (SVM) 
-->K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
**Model Evaluation:**
-->Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. 
-->The best model is selected for final predictions.

**Features**
Prediction Model: Given the patient's medical data, the model predicts whether they are likely to be diabetic or not.
